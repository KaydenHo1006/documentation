eLearning
=========

With the **eLearning** app, you can easily upload content, define learning objectives, manage
attendees, assess students' progress, and even set up rewards. Engaging participants in a meaningful
learning experience enhances their attentiveness and fosters heightened productivity.

.. important::
   You can manage your **eLearning** content on both the **front end** and the **back end**. The
   **front end** allows you to create content quickly from your website, while the **back end**
   allows you to work directly from the app. It gives the same options as the front end but it
   also provides access to more advanced configurations and allows collaboration. This
   documentation presents the eLearning app from the back end.

You can enable different features to customize your courses by going to :menuselection:`eLearning
--> Configuration --> Settings`:

- **Certifications**: To evaluate the knowledge of your attendees and certify their skills;
- **Paid courses**: To sell access to your courses on your website and track revenues;
- **Mailing**: To update all your attendees at once through mass mailings;
- **Forum**: To create a community and let attendees answer each other's questions.

.. note::
   - Enabling :guilabel:`Certifications` installs :guilabel:`Surveys`;
   - Enabling :guilabel:`Paid courses` installs :guilabel:`Invoicing`;
   - Enabling :guilabel:`Mailing` installs :guilabel:`Email Marketing`;
   - Enabling :guilabel:`Forum` installs :guilabel:`Forum`.
