==================
Foreign currencies
==================

With Odoo, pricelists can be used to manage prices in a number of foreign currencies. Specifically,
Odoo has the ability to work with 167 total currencies. In order to use multiple currencies in Odoo
*Sales*, the *Accounting* application **must** be installed.

Settings
========

Once the *Accounting* app is installed, foreign currencies can be viewed, edited, and added to the
database. To do that, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`,
scroll to the :guilabel:`Currencies` section, and locate the :guilabel:`Main Currency` setting.

   :alt: How the main currency feature appears on settings page in Odoo Accounting.

Odoo automatically sets the :guilabel:`Main Currency` as the currency of the country the company is
based in.

To change the main currency of the company, select the drop-down in the :guilabel:`Currency` field,
and select the desired currency. Click :guilabel:`Save` to save all changes.

.. tip::
   To ensure currency rates are updated automatically, enable the :guilabel:`Automatic Currency
   Rates` feature on the *Accounting* :guilabel:`Settings` page (:menuselection:`Accounting app -->
   Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies section`).

   .. image:: currencies/automatic-currency-rates.png
      :align: center
      :alt: How the main currency feature appears on settings page in Odoo Accounting.

   To do that, click the checkbox beside the :guilabel:`Automatic Currency Rates` feature, choose
   a designated bank to get the currency rates from in the :guilabel:`Service` field drop-down,
   select an :guilabel:`Interval` of time for the updates to take place, and then determine when the
   date of the :guilabel:`Next Run` should be.

   The ability to instantly update the currency rates is also available, by clicking the
   :guilabel:`circular arrows` icon, located to the right of the :guilabel:`Next Run` field.

   When all configurations are complete, click :guilabel:`Save` to save all changes.

.. note::
   All payment methods **must** be in the same currency as the Sales Journal, or the company
   currency, if the company currency is not set. If not, a :guilabel:`Validation Error` message
   appears.

View, edit, and add currencies
==============================

To view, edit, and add currencies to the database, and make them available on pricelists and on the
:guilabel:`Main Currency` drop-down, click the :guilabel:`Currencies` link, beneath the
:guilabel:`Currency` field (on the *Accounting* app's :guilabel:`Settings` page).

When the :guilabel:`Currencies` link is clicked, a separate :guilabel:`Currencies` page is revealed.

.. image:: currencies/main-currencies-page.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How the main currencies page appears in Odoo Accounting.

On this page, Odoo provides a master list of 167 global currencies. Each row shows the corresponding
:guilabel:`Currency`, :guilabel:`Symbol`, :guilabel:`Name`, date of the :guilabel:`Last Update`, and
:guilabel:`Current Rate` (compared to the default currency of the country in which the company is
based in).

To the far right, there are two columns, which can be toggled on or off:

- :guilabel:`Use on eBay`: meaning this currency can be used with the connected eBay account (if
  applicable).
- :guilabel:`Active`: meaning this currency is `activated`, which means it can be added to a
  pricelist, or used as the :guilabel:`Main Currency` of the company, if desired (via
  :menuselection:`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies section`).

.. note::
   By default, all the currency options that are :guilabel:`Active` are at the top of the list.

.. tip::
   It's recommended that *at least* one pricelist is created per :guilabel:`Active` currency. See
   also: `/applications/sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing.html` to learn more about
   pricelist configuration.

To toggle these options on/off, click the toggle switch in the row for the corresponding column.
When `on` the color of the switch is green. When `off`, the color of the switch is gray.

Currency detail form
--------------------

To edit any currency on the :guilabel:`Currencies` page, click the desired currency to reveal the
detail form for that specific currency, and proceed to make any necessary changes.

.. image:: currencies/currency-detail-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How a currency detail form looks in Odoo Accounting.

On the currency detail form, the relevant Currency Code appears in the :guilabel:`Currency` field.
Beneath that, the name for the currency is in the :guilabel:`Name` field.

Then, toggle the currency's availabilty with the :guilabel:`Active` toggle: `on` is indicated with
a green switch, and `off` is indicated with a gray switch.

On the right of the currency detail form, the appropriate :guilabel:`Currency Unit` (e.g. `Dollars`)
and :guilabel:`Currency Subunit` (e.g. `Cents`) can be found.

If the currency is meant to be used for eBay purposes, toggle the :guilabel:`Use on eBay` to the
desired activation: `on` is indicated with a green switch, and `off` is indicated with a gray
switch.

Next, under the :guilabel:`Rates` tab, the various conversion rates can be viewed, added, or
deleted. Each row shows the :guilabel:`Date` of that specific rate, the :guilabel:`Company` to which
it is connected, followed by the :guilabel:`Unit per...` and :guilabel:`...per Unit`.

.. note::
      The `...` in each of the last two columns represents the main currency set for the company.
      For example, if the main currency is set to `USD`, the columns will be titled :guilabel:`Unit
      per USD` and :guilabel:`USD per Unit`.

To add a new rate, click :guilabel:`Add a line` in the :guilabel:`Rates` tab, and proceed to fill in
the necessary information in the aforementioned columns.

Main currency detail form
-------------------------

If the selected currency is the :guilabel:`Main Currency` of the company, a blue banner appears at
the top of the currency detail form, with the message: `This is your company's currency.`

.. image:: currencies/main-currency-detail-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How a main currency detail form looks in Odoo Accounting.

All the fields are the same as a typical currency detail form, but there won't be a
:guilabel:`Rates` tab because all other currency rates are based off the main currency of the
company.

Create new currency
===================

If a desired currency isn't on the :guilabel:`Currencies` page, click the :guilabel:`New` button to
open a blank currency template form.

.. tip::
   The same :guilabel:`New` button is located in the upper-right corner of any currency detail form.

.. image:: currencies/blank-currency-detail-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How a blank currency detail form looks in Odoo Accounting.

On the blank currency detail form, proceed to enter the desired Currency Code in the
:guilabel:`Currency` field. Beneath that, enter the name for the currency in the :guilabel:`Name`
field.

Then, toggle the currency's availabilty with the :guilabel:`Active` toggle - `on` is indicated with
a green switch, and `off` is indicated with a gray switch.

On the right of the currency detail form, enter the appropriate :guilabel:`Currency Unit` (e.g.
`Dollars`) and the appropriate :guilabel:`Currency Subunit` (e.g. `Cents`).

If the currency is meant to be used for eBay purposes, toggle the :guilabel:`Use on eBay` to the
desired activation: `on` is indicated with a green switch, and `off` is indicated with a gray
switch.

Next, under the :guilabel:`Rates` tab, add a new rate by clicking :guilabel:`Add a line`. Then,
proceed to confirm and adjust the :guilabel:`Date`, :guilabel:`Company`, :guilabel:`Unit per...`,
and :guilabel:`...per Unit` fields to ensure all the auto-populated information is accurate.

.. note::
      The `...` in each of the last two columns represents the main currency set for the company.
      For example, if the main currency is set to `USD`, the columns will be titled :guilabel:`Unit
      per USD` and :guilabel:`USD per Unit`.

Currency-specific pricelists
============================

It is recommended that *at least* one pricelist is created per :guilabel:`Active` currency in the
database. To create (or assign) a pricelist to a specific currency, start by navigating to
:menuselection:`Sales app --> Products --> Pricelists`.

From the :guilabel:`Pricelists` page, either select an existing pricelist to edit, or click
:guilabel:`New` to create a new pricelist.

On the pricelist detail form, on either a new or existing pricelist, adjust the :guilabel:`Currency`
field as desired.

.. seealso::
   `/applications/sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing.html` to learn more about
   pricelist configuration.

Auto-conversion from public price
=================================

It should be noted that the public price seen on products is directly related to the company's set
:guilabel:`Main Currency`, which is configured by navigating to :menuselection:`Accounting app -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies section --> Main Currency --> Currency drop-down menu`.

However, the sales price automatically updates if the pricelist is changed to one that has a
different currency than the company's :guilabel:`Main Currency`. The change in price is directly
related to the updated conversion rate for that currency.

Set product prices
==================

In order to have product prices set in place to avoid any changes in currency rates, start by
navigating to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Products --> Products`.

From the :guilabel:`Products` page, select the desired product to modify. Or, create a new product
by clicking the :guilabel:`New` button.

Then, from the product detail form, click the :guilabel:`Extra Prices` smart button, located in the
upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a separate :guilabel:`Price Rules` page, specific to that
particular product.

.. image:: currencies/price-rules-currencies.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How to set product prices based on foreign currency pricelists in Odoo Sales.

Click :guilabel:`New`, and select the desired pricelist from the drop-down in the
:guilabel:`Pricelist` column.

The :guilabel:`Applied On` field is auto-populated with the product, so proceed to enter in the
desired figures in the :guilabel:`Min. Quantity` and :guilabel:`Price` fields.

.. note::
   The figure in the :guilabel:`Min. Qunatity` field means that the :guilabel:`Price` being set will
   **only** trigger if at least that amount of product is purchased.

If necessary, configure a :guilabel:`Start Date` and :guilabel:`End Date` for the set prices, as
well. Leaving those columns blank ensures that the set price will remain valid.

Then, if working in a multi-company environment, designate to which company this price rule
should be applied in the :guilabel:`Company` field. Leaving that blank ensures the price rule will
be applied to all companies in the database.

Now, regardless of any changes/updates in conversion, whenever those designated pricelists are
applied to a customer trying to purchase this specific product, these pre-determined set prices
will always appear.
